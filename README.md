# Plex Downloader (Userscript)

A userscript that adds a download button to the Plex desktop interface on https://app.plex.tv/desktop/

Works on episodes, movies, movie collections, whole seasons, and entire shows.

See screenshots for examples of it in use.

Install using a userscript manager of your choice, for example [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) for Chrome.

Note that the owner of the Plex server must allow downloading for this script to function. You can check this by visiting  https://app.plex.tv/desktop/#!/settings/manage-library-access , clicking on the owner of the server you have access to, and checking for "Downloads Allowed" under your permissions on that server.
